/**
 * TrackNamer — which HUMAN a transport track is.
 *
 * The transport spine (turn-source.ts) gives every turn a `trackId` that is stable for the whole
 * meeting but meaningless: `1266` is a number an RTP mixer chose. The DOM tiles and the closed
 * captions know names but are flickery, laggy, and — on Teams — light on NOISE, which is exactly
 * how a participant who was TYPING came to own 65 of 66 labels on a balanced two-speaker tape.
 *
 * The two signals fail in opposite directions, and that is the whole design here:
 *
 *   the transport is right about WHEN and never says WHO
 *   the UI is right about WHO and often wrong about WHEN
 *
 * So the UI is asked its question exactly ONCE per speaker per meeting, under the only condition
 * where it cannot be wrong: a track earns a name from the spans where EXACTLY ONE track was
 * audible AND EXACTLY ONE name was lit. Anything else — two tiles lit, two sources audible, a
 * name lit while nobody is audible — contributes NOTHING. Not a weaker vote: nothing.
 *
 * Three further rules, each of which a real fixture required:
 *
 *   • **Corroboration.** One coincidence is a coincidence. A name is accepted after N (default 2)
 *     separate episodes of at least `minEpisodeMs`, so a single lag artefact cannot name a track.
 *   • **Exclusivity, both ways.** A name belongs to the track holding the clear majority of that
 *     NAME's evidence, and a name already earned is never re-let. On the m30 fixture the other
 *     participant's track accrues 7.5s of "leo" evidence purely from hint lag against leo's 61s —
 *     without this rule both tracks would end up called leo, which is two wrong labels produced
 *     from correct data.
 *   • **A settle delay.** Evidence is integrated only up to `newest - settleMs`, so a hint that
 *     arrives late still lands on the span it describes. Names therefore arrive a few seconds
 *     after the speech does — which is what the retroactive rename path is FOR.
 *
 * A track with no evidence is NOT guessed. It publishes as a stable "Speaker A/B/C" by
 * first-heard order and stays that way. Unknown stays unknown.

   *     override — direct evidence always wins, and a name reached this way is recorded as
   *     'elimination' so a reader can tell the two apart.
